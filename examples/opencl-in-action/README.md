# Examples from 'OpenCL In Action'

This is a Lua port of some of the C examples that come with the book 
[OpenCL in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/opencl-in-action),
by Matthew Scarpino.

Besides [MoonCL](https://github.com/stetre/mooncl), a few examples make use also of the following libraries from the [MoonLibs collection](https://github.com/stetre/moonlibs):
- [MoonImage](https://github.com/stetre/moonimage) for image loading and writing,
- [MoonGLFW](https://github.com/stetre/moonglfw) for window creation and input handling, and
- [MoonGL](https://github.com/stetre/moongl) for rendering.
