[[hostmem]]
=== hostmem

An hostmem object encapsulates (a pointer to) host accessible memory, with methods
to access it from Lua and to retrieve pointers to any of its locations in form of 
http://www.lua.org/manual/5.3/manual.html#lua_pushlightuserdata[lightuserdata].

(Note that hostmem objects are specific to MoonCL, i.e. they do not
correspond to OpenCL objects).

The memory encapsulated by an hostmem object may be either host memory allocated via 
the <<hostmem_malloc, cl.malloc>>(&nbsp;) or the <<hostmem_aligned_alloc, cl.aligned_alloc>>(&nbsp;) 
functions, or memory obtained by other means
(e.g. mapped memory or shared virtual memory)
and passed to the <<hostmem_hostmem, cl.hostmem>>(&nbsp;) constructor.

Hostmem objects are automatically deleted at exit, but they may also be deleted manually
via the <<hostmem_free, cl.free>>(&nbsp;) function (or the corresponding method).

Hostmem objects come in handy, for example, when creating <<buffer, buffers>>, to back them
with host memory, and when using <<commands, asynchronous commands>> to read from,
write to, or map/unmap OpenCL memory objects, i.e. in those operations where a pointer to
a memory area must be passed to or is returned by OpenCL.

[[hostmem_malloc]]
* _hostmem_ = *malloc*(_size_) +
_hostmem_ = *malloc*(_data_) +
_hostmem_ = *malloc*(<<primtype, _primtype_>>, {_value~1~_, _..._, _value~N~_}) +
_hostmem_ = *malloc*(<<primtype, _primtype_>>, _value~1~_, _..._, _value~N~_) +
[small]#Allocates host memory and creates an _hostmem_ object to encapsulate it. +
*malloc*(_size_), where _size_ is an integer, allocates _size_ bytes of contiguous memory
and initializes them to 0; +
*malloc*(_data_), where _data_ is a binary string, allocates _#data_ bytes of contiguous
memory and initializes them with the contents of _data_; +
*malloc*(_primtype_, _..._) is functionally equivalent to _malloc(cl.pack(primtype, ...))_.#

[[hostmem_aligned_alloc]]
* _hostmem_ = *aligned_alloc*(_alignment_, _size_) +
_hostmem_ = *aligned_alloc*(_alignment_, _data_) +
_hostmem_ = *aligned_alloc*(_alignment_, <<primtype, _primtype_>>, {_value~1~_, _..._, _value~N~_}) +
_hostmem_ = *aligned_alloc*(_alignment_, <<primtype, _primtype_>>, _value~1~_, _..._, _value~N~_) +
[small]#Same as <<hostmem_malloc, malloc>>(&nbsp;), with the additional _alignment_ parameter to control
memory address alignment (rfr. _aligned_alloc(3)_).#

[[hostmem_hostmem]]
* _hostmem_ = *hostmem*(_size_, _ptr_) +
_hostmem_ = *hostmem*(_data_) +
[small]#Creates a _hostmem_ object encapsulating user provided memory. +
Such memory may be provided in form of a lightuserdata (_ptr_) containing a valid pointer to _size_ bytes of contiguous memory, or as a binary string (_data_). +
In both cases, care must be taken that the memory area remains valid until the _hostmem_ object is 
deleted, or at least until it is accessed via its methods. 
In the _data_ case, this means ensuring that _data_ is not garbage collected during the hostmem object lifetime. +
(Note that _malloc(data)_ and _hostmem(data)_ differ in that the former allocates memory and copies 
_data_ in it, while the latter just stores a pointer to _data_).#

[[hostmem_free]]
* *free*(_hostmem_) +
hostmem++:++*free*( ) +
[small]#Deletes the _hostmem_ object. If _hostmem_ was created with 
<<hostmem_malloc, cl.malloc>>(&nbsp;) or <<hostmem_aligned_alloc, cl.aligned_alloc>>(&nbsp;), this function also releases the encapsulated memory.#

[[hostmem_ptr]]
* _ptr_  = hostmem++:++*ptr*([_offset_=0], [_nbytes_=0]) +
[small]#Returns a pointer (lightuserdata) to the location at _offset_ bytes from the beginning of the encapsulated memory. +
Raises an error if the requested location is beyond the boundaries of the memory area, or if there are not at least _nbytes_ of memory after it.#

[[hostmem_size]]
* _nbytes_ = hostmem++:++*size*([_offset_=0]) +
_nbytes_ = hostmem++:++*size*(_ptr_) +
[small]#Returns the number of bytes of memory available after _offset_ bytes from the beginning 
of the encapsulated memory area, or after _ptr_ (a lightuserdata obtained with hostmem:<<hostmem_ptr, ptr>>(&nbsp;)).#

[[hostmem_read]]
* _data_ = hostmem++:++*read*([_offset_], [_nbytes_]) +
{_val~1~_, _..._, _val~N~_} = hostmem++:++*read*([_offset_], [_nbytes_], <<primtype, _primtype_>>) +
[small]#Reads _nbytes_ of data starting from _offset_, and returns it as a binary string or as
a table of primitive values. +
The _offset_ parameter defaults to 0, and _nbytes_ defaults to the memory size minus _offset_. +
_hostmem:read(offset, nbytes, primtype)_ is functionally equivalent to 
_cl.unpack(primtype, hostmem:read(offset, nbytes))_.#

[[hostmem_write]]
* hostmem++:++*write*(_offset_, _nil_, _data_) +
hostmem++:++*write*(_offset_, <<primtype, _primtype_>>, _val~1~_, _..._, _val~N~_) +
hostmem++:++*write*(_offset_, <<primtype, _primtype_>>, {_value~1~_, _..._, _value~N~_}) +
[small]#Writes to the encapsulated memory area, starting from the byte at _offset_. +
*write*(_offset_, _nil_, _data_) writes the contents of _data_ (a binary string); +
*write*(_offset_, _primtype_, _..._) is equivalent to _write(offset, nil, cl.pack(primtype, ...))_.#

[[hostmem_copy]]
* hostmem++:++*copy*(_offset_, _size_, _srcptr_) +
hostmem++:++*copy*(_offset_, _size_, _srchostmem_, _srcoffset_) +
[small]#Copies _size_ bytes to the encapsulated memory area, starting from the byte at _offset_. +
*copy*(_offset_, _size_, _srcptr_), copies the _size_ bytes pointed to by _srcptr_ (a lightuserdata). +
*copy*(_offset_, _size_, _srchostmem_, _srcoffset_), copies _size_ bytes from the memory encapsulated
by _srchostmem_ (a hostmem object), starting from the location at _srcoffset_.#

[[hostmem_clear]]
* hostmem++:++*clear*(_offset_, _nbytes_, [_val_=0]) +
[small]#Clears _nbytes_ of memory starting from _offset_. If the _val_ parameter is given,
the bytes are set to its value instead of 0 (_val_ may be an integer or a character, i.e. 
a string of length 1).#
